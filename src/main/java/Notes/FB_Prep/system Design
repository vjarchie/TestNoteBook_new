    ‘Always listen to interviewer - hints/ feedback/direction’

 1. Requirements  - 5 minutes
    Functional -> Use Cases ( dont add more than what you can cover)
    Non fucntional -> Nature of system/Audititg/Monitoring/Security
    "What User experience looks like / high end low end devices/ access to internet or not.
     Ask which parts to explore.
     Ask is this relevant? "
     "Devices support?"
     "network support"
     "Data nature - Data lifecycle - Data sanity"
     "ask minimum 5 questions."
     System Nature - Available - Consistent - Reliable/Durable

 2. Estimation - use calculator
    simple estimation 1-2 min , TPS support.
    "quantitative analysis - more important for system design. ( ask yourself any no, KPIs to take care of)""

 3. High Level Overview or System Interface Design:
    Entities + Rough HLD
    "High Level Complete Proposal - 10-15 minutes. "

 4. Deep Dive:
    "how architecture handle data.
     	completeness of solution.
     		meet functional and non functional requirements
     		identify bottlenecks that could occur.
     	component responsibilities.
     	Better api = better component responsibilities."
    "Deep Dive - 15 minutes ( no less than 10 minutes)
         	2 -3 TOPICS OF ARCHITECTURE
         	TRADEOFF again.
         	!!!!DONT USE BUZZWORDS!!!"

  5. Bottlenecks!
        - points of failure
        - Error Handling
        - monitoring/performance
